CS3790 Lab2 Assignment

This program is intended to use threads to find the primes up to a certain number by dividing the range by the number of threads created.

For example to find the primes from 1 to 15 with 3 threads would have each thread check intervals of 5.

**Refer to the Readme in the cthreads directory or javathreads directory for information on using each program specifically**

*This program only handles a number of threads that evenly divide the maximum number you wish to find primes up to.
