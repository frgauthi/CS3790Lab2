CS3790 Lab2 Assignment

This program is intended to use threads to find the primes up to a certain number by dividing the range by the number of threads created.

For example to find the primes from 1 to 15 with 3 threads would have each thread check intervals of 5.

./lab2 15 3  	in the console will compute the primes up to 15 using 3 threads


type make in the cthreads directory to make the program and then use ./lab2 <max num> <num threads> to run the program
